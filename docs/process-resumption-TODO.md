# Process Resumption Enhancement TODO

## Overview
Enhance the process resumption system to handle server restarts and failures gracefully, ensuring no jobs are lost and all processes can be resumed from their last successful state.

## Core Features

### State Management
- [x] Implement proper state tracking for each process stage
- [x] Store file existence status in state
- [x] Track progress within each stage
- [x] Save console output for debugging
- [x] Ensure consistent space ID generation across codebase
- [ ] Add process start time to state
- [ ] Add process estimated completion time
- [ ] Add process priority level

### Process Recovery
- [x] Auto-detect interrupted processes on startup
- [x] Determine correct stage to resume from
- [x] Resume from last successful stage
- [ ] Add retry count tracking
- [ ] Add maximum retry limit
- [ ] Add backoff strategy for retries
- [ ] Implement process timeout handling

### UI/UX Improvements
- [x] Show resumed processes in sidebar
- [x] Display progress for resumed processes
- [x] Show file status for each stage
- [ ] Add manual resume button for failed processes
- [ ] Add pause/resume functionality
- [ ] Add cancel functionality
- [ ] Add process priority adjustment
- [ ] Add estimated time remaining
- [ ] Add process history view

### Monitoring & Logging
- [x] Log process state changes
- [x] Capture stage-specific output
- [ ] Add process metrics collection
- [ ] Add process timing statistics
- [ ] Add failure rate tracking
- [ ] Add resource usage monitoring
- [ ] Create process audit log
- [ ] Add email notifications for failures

### Data Integrity
- [x] Lock file handling for concurrent access
- [x] Validate file integrity before resuming
- [ ] Add file checksums
- [ ] Add file versioning
- [ ] Add backup of critical state files
- [ ] Add state file validation
- [ ] Add corrupt file detection

## Technical Improvements

### Code Structure
- [ ] Refactor state management into separate class
- [ ] Create ProcessManager class
- [ ] Implement proper dependency injection
- [ ] Add process factory pattern
- [ ] Create process queue manager

### Error Handling
- [ ] Add specific exception types
- [ ] Improve error messages
- [ ] Add error categorization
- [ ] Add error recovery strategies
- [ ] Add circuit breaker pattern

### Testing
- [ ] Add unit tests for state management
- [ ] Add integration tests for process resumption
- [ ] Add failure scenario tests
- [ ] Add load tests
- [ ] Add stress tests for concurrent processes

### Performance
- [ ] Optimize state file I/O
- [ ] Add state caching
- [ ] Implement batch state updates
- [ ] Add process prioritization
- [ ] Add resource throttling

## Documentation
- [ ] Add architecture documentation
- [ ] Add failure recovery guide
- [ ] Add monitoring guide
- [ ] Add troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Add API documentation
- [ ] Add deployment guide

## Future Enhancements
- [ ] Distributed process tracking
- [ ] Process migration between servers
- [ ] Real-time process monitoring
- [ ] Process analytics dashboard
- [ ] Auto-scaling based on load
- [ ] Process optimization suggestions

## Notes
- State files are stored in `storage/state/`
- Process locks are stored in `storage/locks/`
- Each process has unique space_id based on URL hash
- Processes can be in states: 'not_started', 'processing', 'complete', 'error'
- Stages: 'download', 'transcribe', 'quotes', 'summary'

## Dependencies
- Streamlit for UI
- yt-dlp for downloads
- ffmpeg for audio processing
- DeepSeek API for processing
